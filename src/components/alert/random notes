Figure out how exactly alerts are going to be sent to the user.
They should be handled in the back end, I think.
There should be a table called 'see':
    1. The table should have all events combined together with all users
    2. The table should have an additional boolean attribute, called 'seen'

Another idea:
Alerts = notifactions for events that were added / updated from when the user last logged in.
Idea: Event contains a date_added. 
    Get all events, and filter out events that contain a date_added from before the user last logged in.
    In other words, only keep events that were added / updated from when the user last logged in.
    These will represent our alerts as per the definition above.
    Though to do this, we'll need to know when the user last logged in: some backend work will likely be required.

As a sidenote, we'll need to be able to fetch an admin's name given their admin ID since Event only contains admin_id
